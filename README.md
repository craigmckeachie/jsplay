# JavaScript Playground

A simple playground to test JavaScript language features and see the output.
Running `npm start`:
1. Starts up the Babel compiler and compiles `src\program.js` to `lib\program.js`.
2. Runs `lib\program.js` under `nodemon` so that any changes to `src\program.js` are automatically run again and the output is shown.


## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```
